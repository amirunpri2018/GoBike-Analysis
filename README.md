# GoBike Analysis Project
- Use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and BiqQuery to perform analysis on Ford GoBike Dataset.  Analysis done to answer business-driven questions using public datasets housed in GCP. 
- We will be using the Bay Area Bike Share Trips Data (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/bay-bike-share). 

#### Problem Statement
- As a Data scientist, analyze Ford GoBike dataset (https://www.fordgobike.com/), the company running Bay Area Bikeshare. The goal is to increase ridership, and to offer deals through the mobile app to do so. What deals can be offered? Currently, your company has three options: a flat price for a single one-way trip, a day pass that allows unlimited 30-minute rides for 24 hours and an annual membership.
